      <h2>INR Mate – Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><em>Effective date: 25 September 2025</em></p>
      <p>INR Mate is designed to work entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, sell, or share your personal data.</p>

      <h3>Quick summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data collected by the developer:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Accounts / Logins:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking / Advertising:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics / Crash reporting:</strong> None sent to us (Apple may provide aggregated diagnostics if you’ve opted in).</li>
        <li><strong>Where your data lives:</strong> On your device only. If you enable system features like iCloud backup or Health app, Apple handles that data under their own policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> INR Mate uses local on-device reminders. No remote push, no device tokens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This policy describes how <strong>oddfruit</strong> (“we”) handles information in the iOS app <strong>INR Mate</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Data we do not collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No servers or backend of our own.</li>
        <li>No analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</li>
        <li>No push notifications or device token registration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>On-device data and processing</h3>
      <p>All data (INR results, dosing, notes) stays local on your device. Deleting the app removes it.</p>

      <h3>Notifications (local)</h3>
      <p>Dose reminders are scheduled and delivered on-device via iOS. No data is sent to us.</p>

      <h3>Optional system features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health app (HealthKit):</strong> If enabled, data stays on device under your permissions; we never see it.</li>
        <li><strong>Exports / Sharing:</strong> Exports are created locally; you choose if / where to share.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>iCloud Backups (Apple)</h3>
      <p>Any iCloud backups are managed by Apple under their privacy policy. We have no access to them.</p>

      <h3>Diagnostics from Apple</h3>
      <p>If you’ve opted in to share diagnostics with developers, Apple may provide us with aggregated crash logs only. We don’t use these to identify you.</p>

      <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
      <p>We collect no data from anyone, including children. If a child contacts us, we delete any personal information immediately.</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Your data is protected by iOS encryption and device security (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID, passcode).</p>

      <h3>Your rights (UK/EU/EEA – GDPR; California – CCPA)</h3>
      <p>Because we don’t collect data, rights such as access, deletion, or portability generally don’t apply. If you email us, we use your message only to reply and delete it on request.</p>

      <h3>Third parties</h3>
      <p>No third-party SDKs for ads or analytics. Any Apple service data (e.g., iCloud, Health) is governed by Apple’s terms.</p>

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>Email support@oddfruit.dev  |  Developer: oddfruit</p>

      <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
      <p>If we add cloud features in future, we’ll update this policy and App Store privacy label before release.</p>

      <h3>Medical disclaimer</h3>
      <p>INR Mate is for tracking purposes only and does not provide medical advice. Always follow your care team’s guidance.</p>
