      <h2>INR Mate – Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><em>Effective date: 25 September 2025</em></p>
      <p>INR Mate is designed to work entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, sell, or share your personal data.</p>
      <h3>Quick summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data collected by the developer:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Accounts/Logins:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking/Advertising:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics/Crash reporting:</strong> None sent to us. (Apple may provide aggregated diagnostics if you’ve opted in—see below.)</li>
        <li><strong>Where your data lives:</strong> On your device only. If you enable system features like iCloud backup or Health app, Apple stores/handles that data under Apple’s policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> INR Mate uses <strong>local notifications</strong> (on-device) for reminders. We do <strong>not</strong> use remote push notifications and we do <strong>not</strong> register device tokens.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This policy describes how <strong>oddfruit</strong> (“we,” “us”) handles information in the iOS app <strong>INR Mate</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Data we do not collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not run our own servers for this app.</li>
        <li>We do not integrate third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li>We do not track you across apps or websites.</li>
        <li>We do not use remote push notifications and do not register or share device tokens.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>On-device data and processing</h3>
      <p>INR Mate is a personal record tool. Any information you enter (e.g., INR results, dose schedules, notes) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and processed on-device. Deleting the app removes this local data.</p>
      <h3>Notifications (local)</h3>
      <p>If you enable dose reminders, they are scheduled and delivered <strong>on your device</strong> via iOS’s notification system. No reminder data is sent to us.</p>
      <h3>Optional system features you control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health app (HealthKit) – if you choose to enable it (now or in future versions):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Any reading/writing happens between INR Mate and your Health app on your device, under your explicit permissions.</li>
            <li>We do not receive this data.</li>
            <li>Health data is used only to display and manage your records for your personal use—never for advertising, marketing, or data selling/sharing.</li>
            <li>You can change or revoke permissions at any time in iOS Settings &gt; Health.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exports &amp; Sharing:</strong> If you export PDF/CSV files, the files are created on your device. You choose if/where to share them (e.g., email, Files, messaging). We do not receive copies unless you send them to us (e.g., for support).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>iCloud Backups (Apple)</h3>
      <p>If you use iCloud device backups or iCloud Drive, your device may back up INR Mate’s local data to Apple’s services. That is controlled by your iOS/iCloud settings and governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy. We do not have access to your iCloud backups.</p>
      <h3>Diagnostics from Apple (optional)</h3>
      <p>If you have opted in at the system level to share diagnostics &amp; usage with app developers, Apple may provide us with <strong>aggregated and de-identified</strong> crash logs and performance data. We use these only to improve stability and performance. We do not use this information to identify you.</p>
      <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
      <p>INR Mate is a general-audience app. We do not collect personal data from anyone, including children. If you believe a child has sent us personal information directly (e.g., by emailing support), please contact us so we can delete it.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Your data is protected by iOS security features on your device (e.g., device encryption, Face ID/Touch ID/passcode). We recommend keeping your device up to date and secured with a passcode/biometric lock.</p>
      <h3>Your rights (UK/EU/EEA – GDPR; California – CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
      <p>Because we do not collect or store personal data, rights such as access, deletion, correction, portability, or opting out of sale/share generally do not apply to us.
      If you contact us and share personal information (e.g., via support email), we will use it only to respond and then delete it upon request, unless we must retain it to comply with law.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sale/Share of data:</strong> We do not sell or share personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Profiling/Automated decisions:</strong> None.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Third parties</h3>
      <p>We do not integrate third-party SDKs for ads, analytics, or tracking. Any data handled by Apple services (e.g., iCloud, Health) is governed by Apple’s terms and privacy policy.</p>

      <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>

If any future feature involves server-side processing or data collection, we will update the App Privacy details and this policy before release.</p>
